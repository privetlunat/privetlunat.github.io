File Header
	There is only one file header in a binary file.  The file header consists of the 
following information.
Cookie   Two byte characters, AG, which indicates that 
the file is in the Agilent Binary Data file format.
Version   Two bytes which represent the file version.
File Size   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the number 
of bytes that are in the file.
Number of
Waveforms
   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the number 
of waveforms that are stored in the file.
Waveform Header
   The waveform header contains information about the type of waveform data 
that is stored following the waveform data header which is located after each 
waveform header.  Because it is possible to store more than one waveform in 
the file, there will be a waveform header and a waveform data header for each
waveform.
Header Size
   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the number 
of bytes in the header.
Waveform Type
   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the type of 
waveform that is stored in the file.  The follow 
shows what each value means.
0 = Unknown
1 = Normal
2 = Peak Detect
3 = Average
4 = Horizontal Histogram
5 = Vertical Histogram
6 = Logic
Number of Waveform Buffers
   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the number 
of waveform buffers required to read the data.  
This value is one except for peak detect data and digital data.
Count
   An integer (4 byte signed) which  is the number 
of hits at each time bucket in the waveform 
record when the waveform was created using an 
acquisition mode like averaging. For example, 
when averaging, a count of four would mean 
every waveform data point in the waveform 
record has been averaged at least four times. 
The default value is 0.
X Display Range
   A float (4 bytes) which is the X-axis duration of 
the waveform that is displayed.  For time domain 
waveforms, it is the duration of time across the 
display.   If the value is zero then no data has 
been acquired.
X Display Origin
   A double (8 bytes) which is the X-axis value at 
the left edge of the display.  For time domain 
waveforms, it is the time at the start of the 
display.  This value is treated as a double 
precision 64-bit floating point number.   If the 
value is zero then no data has been acquired. 
X Increment
   A double (8 bytes) which is the duration 
between data points on the X axis.  For time 
domain waveforms, this is the time between 
points.  If the value is zero then no data has been 
acquired.
X Origin
   A double (8 bytes) which is the X-axis value of 
the first data point in the data record.  For time 
domain waveforms, it is the time of the first 
point.  This value is treated as a double precision 
64-bit floating point number.   If the value is zero 
then no data has been acquired.
X Units
   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the number 
of X units columns (n) depends on the number 
of sources being stored.  The X units is the unit 
of measure for each time value of the acquired 
data.  X unit definitions are:
0 = Unkown
1 = Volt
2 = Second
3 = Constant
4 = Amp
5 = Decibel
Y Units
   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the number 
of Y units columns (n) depends on the number 
of sources being stored.  The Y units is the unit 
of measure of each voltage value of the acquired 
waveform.  Y units definitions are:
0 = Unkown
1 = Volt
2 = Second
3 = Constant
4 = Amp
5 = Decibel
Date
   A 16 character array which is the date when the 
waveform was acquired. The default value is 27 
DEC 1996.
Time
   A 16 character array which is the time when the 
waveform was acquired. The default value is 
01:00:00:00.
Frame
   A 24 character array which is the model number 
and serial number of the scope in the format of 
MODEL#:SERIAL#.
Waveform Label
   A 16 character array which is the waveform 
label.
Time Tags
   A double (8 bytes) which is the time tag value of 
the segment being saved.
Segment Index
   An unsigned integer (4 byte signed) which is the 
segment index of the data that follows the 
waveform data header.
The waveform data header consists of 
information about the waveform data points that 
are stored immediately after the waveform data 
header.
Waveform Data Header Size
   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the size of 
the waveform data header.
Buffer Type
   A short (2 byte signed) which is the type of 
waveform data that is stored in the file.  The 
following shows what each value means.
0 = Unknown data
1 = Normal 32 bit float data
2 = Maximum float data
3 = Minimum float data
4 = Time float data
5 = Counts 32 bit float data
6 = Digital unsigned 8 bit char data
Bytes Per Point
   A short (2 byte signed) which is the number of 
bytes per data point.
Buffer Size
   An integer (4 byte signed) which is the size of 
the buffer required to hold the data bytes.
